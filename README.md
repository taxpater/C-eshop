<h1 align="center">c-eshop</h1>
This repository contains the code for a project assigned as part of a prgramming lab, as a way to evaluate and enhance our knowledge in inter-process communication (IPC) utilising pipes, and the fork() function. Moreover, it is a simulation of an e-shop where 5 different clients submit 10 orders each to the server, wait for the server to handle their order, and then return them whether the order was completed successfully or not. When all orders are processed, the server outputs a statistics report of the performance of each product, and of the shop as a whole.

The code contains comments in most parts to ensure easy understanding of it's functionality.

> [!WARNING]
> If you wish to run this program on your local system as is, it is required to be using a UNIX system that supports make-file, and has the gcc compiler available. In any other case, you will have to modify the make-file to use the compiler of your choice, or compile all the files one by one manually.

As this repository serves as an archive for the project, contributions will not be accepted on the main branch, unless they are adressing a possible error with my code, or suggesting minor improvements that don't alter what the code does.
